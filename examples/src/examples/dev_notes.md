Any example that has a compareTo value is either based on or directly comparable to another example.
In these cases, we should try to keep our examples as close as reasonably possible to the upstream/comparable/variant example so that they can be compared more directly with each other and any differences that will be visible will be to make a point rather than distract from the comparison being made.
As such, some duplication is tolerated in order to make it match as closely as possible the original upstream example.
